# MGMT
A Java Swing application for a sign-in program based on employee id.

PENDING:
- Backend
    - Sign-in protocol (timing)
    - Transfer ArrayList data to text file for full-time access and not just run-time, also saves data
- Frontend (LESS URGENT)
    - Perhaps change admin and new_user JFrames to JDialogs
    - Make sure functionality is completely cross-platform
    - Remove unused LaF's
