PENDING:

    - Change admin and new_user JFrames to JDialogs
    - Make sure functionality is completely cross-platform
    - Remove unused LaF's
    
Deployment:
- This is an Eclipse project, so the process for deployment will be shown using the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
    - Download eclipse from eclipse.org and complete installation
    - Open eclipse in your workspace and import project titled "MGMT" wherever you have cloned the repository.
    - Run "Main.java" and the GUI should show.
    - You may also use the JAR (Java ARchive) file provided (however this works a little differently shown in the release).
